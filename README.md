# BrickBreak in C

Just messing around with building games in C from scratch using Raylib. This one is brick breaker... or at least should be if it gets completed.

## Build

This will build and generate the MACOS executable of the game.

```sh
sh build.sh
```

Currently leveraging the[nob.h](https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h/tree/main) build system.
